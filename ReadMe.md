## Overview
ZK Compression is introduced on Solana and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, designed to enable scalable application development. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and state compression, this technology drastically reduces on-chain storage costs while maintaining network security, performance, and composability.

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Enables handling of large datasets efficiently, fostering innovation in decentralized applications (dApps).
2. **Cost Savings**: Reduces deployment and operational costs for blockchain projects.
3. **Simplified Development**: Provides an all-in-one environment for building applications without additional layers or complexities.
4. **Mass Adoption**: Facilitates broader adoption of blockchain technologies by lowering barriers for institutions and mainstream users.


## Use Cases
- Large-scale airdrops
- Token account management
- Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications
- Gaming and NFT platforms
